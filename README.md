# ArduinoFolder

Collection of small embedded projects for arduino.

Notable projects are:
- Heating controller which has a number of iterations but uses a web interface to turn on/off my ancient heating system.

 - 12V control which gives an electric coolbox sleep and intermittent and split charging functionality for use in my van.

- catScarer, unfortunately named but this project used a motion  controller to tel when my cat jumped onto the kitchen counters and then used a servo to fire a short burst
of compressed air to deter that behaviour.
